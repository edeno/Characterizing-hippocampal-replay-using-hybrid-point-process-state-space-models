  abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, the major class of excitatory efferent cortical cells. The calciumbinding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins.On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons.Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immuno-reactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex.These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in both normal and disease states.},

  abstract = {The distribution of the prosomatostatin-derived peptides (PSDP) somatostatin-28 (SS-28) and somatostatin-281\textendash{}12 (SS-281\textendash{}12) was characterized immunohistochemically in the prefrontal cortical regions of both Old World cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and New Worldsquirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Comparison of staining with antisera specific for each peptide revealed that these antigens were segregated within immunoreactive neurons such that SS-28 was largely confined to theperinuclear region of the cell body whereas SS-281\textendash{}12 was primarily found in axons and dendrites.The laminar pattern of immunoreactive fibers was similar in all areas of the prefrontal cortex. The most dense terminal arborization was in layers I, II, and superficial III. Deep III and IV were traversed by radial fibersthat had little arborization. Layers V and VI contained both radial fibers and a moderately dense terminal plexus. Labeled fibers were less numerous in the white matter. There were marked regional differences in fiber density. Areas 12 and 24 had the greatest density of immunoreactive fibers, areas 9, 11, and 25 were of intermediate density, and areas 10 and 46 were the least dense.Most of the immunoreactive cells appeared to be multipolar or bitufted. They were found throughout all cortical layers and the white matter. The largest number were located in layers II, superficial III, and deep V and VI. There were also marked regional differences in cell body density, which paralleled the regional differences in fiber density. Area 24 (anterior cingulate) had the greatest density of immunoreactive cell bodies (148 {$\pm$} 14/mm2), area 9 was of intermediate density (109 {$\pm$} 13/mm2), and area 46 was the least dense (83 {$\pm$} 12/mm2).Our findings indicate that PSDP compose a complex and extensive cortical system that is largely or totally intrinsic. The substantial regional heterogeneity in density exhibited by PSDP-containing neurons has not previously been reported for an intrinsic cortical system. The laminar and regionalinnervation patterns of these fibers and cell bodies suggest that the PSDP cortical system may play an important role in the polymodal information processing that occurs in association regions of prefrontal cortex.},

  shorttitle = {Horizontal {{Synaptic Connections}} in {{Monkey Prefrontal Cortex}}},
  abstract = {In monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), long-distance, horizontally oriented intrinsic axon collaterals interconnect clusters of pyramidal neurons in the supragranular layers. In order to study the electrophysiological responses mediated by these long-distance projections, an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC was used to obtain whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo tracer injections, we found that long-distance projections were well preserved in PFC slices cut in the coronal plane. Postsynaptic currents were evoked by low-intensity electrical extracellular stimulation applied successively to 20\textendash{}30 discrete sites located up to 2200 {$\mu$}m lateral to the recorded cell. Several criteria were applied to discriminate between monoand polysynaptic responses. Long-distance monosynaptic connections were mediated by fibers with relatively slow conduction velocity (0.14 m/s). Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by stimulation of shortor long-distance horizontal connections did not differ in kinetic properties. The majority (77\%) of the 35 layer 3 PFC neurons studied were monosynaptic targets of long-distance connections. EPSCs mediated by long-distance connections had amplitudes that were similar or even larger than short-distance EPSCs, suggesting that excitatory input provided by the former was relatively robust. For most neurons (87.5\%) in which a full complement of monosynaptic EPSCs was evoked by multisite stimulation, the EPSC amplitude as a function of stimulation distance from the recorded cells exhibited statistically significant peaks. The spacing between peaks was similar to the spacing between interconnected clusters of neurons observed in previous anatomical studies. The results show that long-distance excitatory connections constitute a significant intrinsic pathway of synaptic communication in layer 3 of monkey PFC.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic connections are likely to play important roles in cognitive information processing to in the prefrontal association cortex. To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2\textendash{}7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV\textendash{}VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3\textendash{}5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling ({$\sim$} 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labsled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands. The intrinsic connections identified in this study differ from the local circuits of corresponding layers reported for primary visual cortex; the unique intrinsic wiring diagram of the prefrontal cortex may be related to its specialized cognitive and mnemonic functions. \textcopyright{} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Neurons of the neocortex differ dramatically in the patterns of action potentials they generate in response to current steps. Regular-spiking cells adapt strongly during maintained stimuli, whereas fast-spiking cells can sustain very high firing frequencies with little or no adaptation. Instrinsically bursting cells generate clusters of spikes (bursts), either singly or repetitively. These physiological distinctions have morphological correlates. RS and IB cells can be either pyramidal neurons or spiny stellate cells, and thus constitute the excitatory cells of the cortex. FS cells are smooth or sparsely spiny non-pyramidal cells, and are likely to be GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. The different firing properties of neurons in neocortex contribute significantly to its network behavior.},

The schizophrenic and manic subjects both demonstrated poor performance on the WCST, suggesting that cognitive inflexibility and/or pre-frontal dysfunction, is not specific to schizophrenia (although laterality differences could exist). Moderate levels of poor performance in the non-psychiatric control group suggest the need for a review of the cut-off figures in the WCST currently used for predicting 'brain damage' and 'focal frontal involvement', especially given the trend for the increasing use of cognitive assessment and rehabilitation in the major psychoses.},

  abstract = {Objective: Problems with inhibiting certain pathological behaviors are integral to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania, and other putative obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. The authors assessed and compared motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility in OCD and trichotillomania for the first time, to their knowledge. Method: The Stop-Signal Task and the Intradimensiona/Extradimensional Shift Task were administered to 20 patients with OCD, 17 patients with trichotillomania, and 20 healthy comparison subjects. Results: Both OCD and trichotillomania showed impaired inhibition of motor responses. For trichotillomania, the deficit was worse than for OCD, and the degree of the deficit correlated significantly with symptom severity. Only patients with OCD showed deficits in cognitive flexibility. Conclusions: Impaired inhibition of motor responses (impulsivity) was found in OCD and trichotillomania, whereas cognitive inflexibility (thought to contribute to compulsivity) was limited to OCD. This assessment will advance the characterization and classification of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and aid the development of novel treatments.Abstract Teaser},

  abstract = {In the CNS, activity of individual neurons has a small but quantifiable relationship to sensory representations and motor outputs. Coactivation of a few 10s to 100s of neurons can code sensory inputs and behavioral task performance within psychophysical limits. However, in a sea of sensory inputs and demand for complex motor outputs how is the activity of such small subpopulations of neurons organized? Two theories dominate in this respect: increases in spike rate (rate coding) and sharpening of the coincidence of spiking in active neurons (temporal coding). Both have computational advantages and are far from mutually exclusive. Here, we review evidence for a bias in neuronal circuits toward temporal coding and the coexistence of rate and temporal coding during population rhythm generation. The coincident expression of multiple types of gamma rhythm in sensory cortex suggests a mechanistic substrate for combining rate and temporal codes on the basis of stimulus strength.},

Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.},

Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals.},

  abstract = {During relaxed wakefulness, the human brain exhibits pronounced rhythmic electrical activity in the {$\alpha$} frequency band (8-13 Hz). This activity consists of 3 main components: the classic occipital {$\alpha$} rhythm, the Rolandic {$\mu$} rhythm, and the so-called third rhythm. In recent years, the long-held belief that {$\alpha$} rhythms are strongly influenced by the thalamus has been confirmed in several animal models and, in humans, is well supported by numerous noninvasive imaging studies. Of specific importance is the emergence of 2 key cellular thalamic mechanisms, which come together to generate locally synchronized {$\alpha$} activity. First, a novel form of rhythmic burst firing, termed high-threshold (HT) bursting, which occurs in a specialized subset of thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and second, the interconnection of this subset via gap junctions (GJs). Because repetitive HT bursting in TC neurons occurs in the range of 2 to13 Hz, with the precise frequency increasing with increasing depolarization, the same cellular components that underlie thalamic {$\alpha$} rhythms can also lead to \texttheta{} (2-7 Hz) rhythms when the TC neuron population is less depolarized. As such, this scenario can explain both the deceleration of {$\alpha$} rhythms that takes place during early sleep and the chronic slowing that characterizes a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

Both areas are innervated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region associated with emotions and memory but is also important for attentional control through unknown synaptic mechanisms. Here, we found that in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) most axon terminals labeled from tracers injected into ACC area 32 innervated spines of presumed excitatory neurons, but {$\sim$}20\textendash{}30\% formed mostly large synapses with dendritic shafts of presumed inhibitory neurons in the upper layers (I\textendash{}IIIa) of dorsolateral areas 10, 46, and 9. Moreover, area 32 terminals targeted preferentially calbindin and, to a lesser extent, calretinin neurons, which are thought to be inhibitory neurons that modulate the gain of task-relevant activity during working memory tasks. Area 46 was distinguished as a recipient of more (by {$\sim$}40\%) area 32 synapses on putative inhibitory neurons. Area 10 stood apart as recipient of significantly larger (by {$\sim$}40\% in volume) area 32 terminals on spines of putative excitatory neurons. These synaptic specializations suggest that area 32 has complementary roles, potentially enhancing inhibition in area 46 and strengthening excitation in area 10, which may help direct attention to new tasks while temporarily holding in memory another task.},

  issn = {0962-8436, 1471-2970},
  abstract = {In this, the first of three papers, the nature of, and motivation for, neuronal transients is described in relation to characterizing brain dynamics. This paper deals with some basic aspects of neuronal dynamics, interactions, coupling and implicit neuronal codes. The second paper develops neuronal transients and nonlinear coupling in the context of dynamic instability and complexity, and suggests that instability or lability is necessary for adaptive self\textendash{}organization. The final paper addresses the role of neuronal transients through information theory and the emergence of spatio\textendash{}temporal receptive fields and functional specialization.
By considering the brain as an ensemble of connected dynamic systems one can show that a sufficient description of neuronal dynamics comprises neuronal activity at a particular time and its recent history. This history constitutes a neuronal transient. As such, transients represent a fundamental metric of neuronal interactions and, implicitly, a code employed in the functional integration of brain systems. The nature of transients, expressed conjointly in distinct neuronal populations, reflects the underlying coupling among populations. This coupling may be synchronous (and possibly oscillatory) or asynchronous. A critical distinction between synchronous and asynchronous coupling is that the former is essentially linear and the latter is nonlinear. The nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context\textendash{}sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions. The distinction between linear and nonlinear coupling has fundamental implications for the analysis and characterization of neuronal interactions, most of which are predicated on linear (synchronous) coupling (e.g. crosscorrelograms and coherence). Using neuromagnetic data it is shown that nonlinear (asynchronous) coupling is, in fact, more abundant and can be more significant than synchronous coupling.},

Activation levels in these regions were negatively correlated, with activation increasing in the ACd and decreasing in the OFC when the selected response was the result of the participant's own decision. The pattern was reversed when the selected response was guided by the experimenter rather than the participant.

  abstract = {A principal function of the medial frontal cortex, in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is to monitor action. The error-related negativity (ERN, or NE), an event-related brain potential, reflects medial frontal action-monitoring processes. Specifically, the error-detection theory of the ERN states that the ERN reflects ACC processing that is directly related to detecting the error. This theory predicts that ERN and ACC activity should increase directly with the dissimilarity of the error from the correct response, with similarity defined with respect to the common movement features of the responses. In contrast, the conflict-detection theory claims that ACC and ERN activity represent the detection of response conflict. This theory predicts that the activity should increase directly with the similarity of the error and the correct response. To test these theories, we investigated the effects of response similarity and conflict on the ERN, using a task that involved hand and foot movements. ERN activity was largest under conditions of high response conflict, where the error was similar to the correct response. This finding favors the conflict-detection theory over the error-detection theory, although the ERN was not associated with posterror slowing, as predicted by proponents of both theories. Discrepancies between our results and those of past studies may stem from the use in previous studies of four-finger response tasks which are subject to unique physiological and biomechanical constraints. We conclude that the ERN reflects medial frontal activity involved in the detection or affective processing of response conflict.},

In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity.},

We focus on data obtained from interference tasks, such as the Stroop task, and review the evidence that trial-to-trial changes in control engagement can be understood as driven by conflict detection; the data suggest that levels of activation of the ACC and the DLPFC in such tasks do indeed reflect conflict and control, respectively.

  abstract = {The authors present a unified account of 2 neural systems concerned with the development and expression of adaptive behaviors: a mesencephalic dopamine system for reinforcement learning and a "generic" error-processing system associated with the anterior cingulate cortex. The existence of the error-processing system has been inferred from the error-related negativity (ERN), a component of the event-related brain potential elicited when human participants commit errors in reaction-time tasks. The authors propose that the ERN is generated when a negative reinforcement learning signal is conveyed to the anterior cingulate cortex via the mesencephalic dopamine system and that this signal is used by the anterior cingulate cortex to modify performance on the task at hand. They provide support for this proposal using both computational modeling and psychophysiological experimentation.},

  abstract = {An investigation of the architectonic organization and intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex was conducted in rhesus monkeys. Cytoarchitectonic analysis indicates that in the prefrontal cortex there are two trends of gradual change in laminar characteristics that can be traced from limbic periallocortex towards isocortical areas. The stepwise change in laminar features is characterized by the emergence and gradual increase in the width of granular layer IV, by an increase in the size of pyramidal cells in layers III and V, and by a higher cell-packing density in the supragranular layers. Myeloarchitectonic analysis reveals that the limbic areas are poorly myelinated, adjacent areas have a diffuse myelin content confined to the deep layers, and in isocortices the myelinated fibers are distributed in organized horizontal bands (of Baillarger) and a vertical plexus. Using the above architectonic criteria, we observed that one of the architectonic trends takes a radial basoventral course from the periallocortex in the caudal orbitofrontal region to the adjacent proisocortex and then to area 13. The next stage of architectonic regions includes orbital areas 12, 11, and 14, which is followed by area 10, lateral area 12, and the rostral part of ventral area 46. The last group includes the caudal part of ventral area 46 and ventral area 8. The other trend takes a mediodorsal course from the periallocortex around the rostral portion of the corpus callosum to the adjacent proisocortical areas 24, 25, and 32 and then to the medially situated isocortical areas 9, 10, and 14. The next stage includes lateral areas 10 and 9 and the rostral part of dorsal area 46. The last group includes the caudal part of dorsal area 46 and dorsal area 8.The interconnections of subdivisions of the basoventral and mediodorsal cortices were studied with the aid of anterograde and retrograde tracers. Within each trend a given area projects in two directions: to adjoining regions belonging to succeeding architectonic stages on the one hand, and to nearby regions from the preceding architectonic stage on the other. In each direction there is more than one region involved in this projection system, paralleling the radial nature of architectonic change. Periallo- and proisocortices have widespread intrinsic connections, whereas isocortices situated at a distance from limbic areas, such as area 8, have restricted connections. Most interconnections are limited to areas within the same architectonic trend. However, there are links between cortices from the two trends, and these seem to occur between areas that are at a similar stage of architectonic differentiation.The results suggest that there are two architectonically, and perhaps functionally, distinct axes within the prefrontal cortex. The earliest stages within each axis, which have widespread connections, may have a global role in neural processing. On the other hand, the latest stages, which have restricted connections, may have a more specific role in processes associated with the frontal lobe.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that each region had a specific combination of control signals; resting-state functional connectivity grouped the regions into distinct `fronto-parietal' and `cingulo-opercular' components. The fronto-parietal component seems to initiate and adjust control; the cingulo-opercular component provides stable `set-maintenance' over entire task epochs. Graph analysis showed dense local connections within components and weaker `long-range' connections between components, suggesting a small-world architecture. The control systems of the brain seem to embody the principles of complex systems, encouraging resilient performance.},

  abstract = {Attention to a stimulus enhances both neuronal responses and gamma frequency synchrony in visual area V4, both of which should increase the impact of attended information on downstream neurons. To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1, V2, and V4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40\textendash{}60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6\textendash{}16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.},

  abstract = {Some thalamocortical pathways display an ``augmenting response'' when stimuli are delivered at frequencies between 7 and 14 Hz. Cortical responses to the first three stimuli of a series increase progressively in amplitude and are relatively stable thereafter. We have investigated the cellular mechanisms of the augmenting response using extracellular and intracellular recordings in vivo and in slices of the sensorimotor neocortex of the rat.
Single stimuli to the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus of the thalamus generate EPSPs followed by feedforward IPSPs that hyperpolarize cells in layer V. A long-latency depolarization interrupts the IPSP with a peak at {$\sim$}200 msec. A second VL stimulus delivered during the hyperpolarization and before the peak of the long-latency depolarization yields an augmenting response. The shortest latency for augmenting responses occurs in cells of layer V, and they appear in dendrites and somata recorded in upper layers {$\sim$}5 msec later. Recordings in vitro show that some layer V cells have hyperpolarization-activated and deinactivated conductances that may serve to increase their excitability after IPSPs. Also in vitro, cells from layer V, but not from layer III, generated augmenting responses at the same stimulation frequencies that were effective in vivo. Control experiments indicated that neither paired-pulse depression of IPSPs nor presynaptically mediated facilitation can account for the augmenting response. Active dendritic conductances contribute to the spread of augmenting responses into upper layers by way of back-propagating fast spikes, which attenuate with repetition, and long-lasting spikes, which enhance in parallel with the augmenting response. In conclusion, we propose that the initiation of augmenting responses depends on an interaction between inhibition, intrinsic membrane properties, and synaptic interconnections of layer V pyramidal neurons.},

Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium conductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strongly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices of neocortex generated epochs of 4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations.

  abstract = {Field potential oscillations in the \textasciitilde{}10 Hz range are known as the alpha rhythm. The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that: (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.},

At the cellular level, the new evidence that certain types of neuron have intrinsic oscillatory properties that may underlie rhythmic EEG activities is discussed. In particular, the question of whether spindle oscillations are autonomous or input-dependent is addressed. At the neural network level, the main circuits of the thalamus and cortex that are responsible for the occurrence and modulation of spindles and alpha activity are described. In addition, the properties of rhythmic activities outside the alpha band are considered, particularly in relation to the prominent beta activity of the visual cortex. At the theoretical level, the possibility that neural networks may behave as complex dynamic systems with the properties of deterministic chaos is discussed. Finally, the fact that brain rhythms may have functional implications for the working of neural networks is examined in relation to 2 cases: the possibility that oscillations may subserve a gating function, and that oscillations may play a role in the formation of assemblies of neurons that represent given stimulus patterns.},

Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD\textendash{}MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and their potential for alpha pacemaking. The role of each alpha current generator was further delineated by Granger causality analyses. In V2 and V4, alpha current generators were found in all layers, with the infragranular generator acting as primary local pacemaking generator. In contrast, in IT, alpha current generators were found only in supragranular and infragranular layers, with the supragranular generator acting as primary local pacemaking generator. The amplitude of alpha activity in V2 and V4 was negatively correlated with behavioral performance, whereas the opposite was true in IT. The alpha rhythm in IT thus appears to differ from that in the lower-order cortices, both in terms of its underlying physiological mechanism and its behavioral correlates. This work may help to reconcile some of the diverse findings and conclusions on the functional significance of alpha band oscillations in the visual system.},

  abstract = {A quintessential feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization, and characterizing the activity patterns in different layers is an important step in understanding cortical processing. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings in rat visual cortex, we show that the temporal patterns of ongoing synaptic inputs to pyramidal neurons exhibit clear laminar specificity. Although low-frequency ({$\sim$}2 Hz) activity is widely observed in layer 2/3 (L2/3), a narrow-band fast oscillation (10\textendash{}15 Hz) is prominent in layer 5 (L5). This fast oscillation is carried exclusively by excitatory inputs. Moreover, the frequency of ongoing activity is strongly correlated with the spatiotemporal window of visual integration: Neurons with fast-oscillating spontaneous inputs exhibit transient visual responses and small receptive fields (RFs), whereas those with slow inputs show prolonged responses and large RFs. These findings suggest that the neural representation of visual information within each layer is strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of the local network manifest in spontaneous activity.},

We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial attention task. The pulvinar synchronized activity between interconnected cortical areas according to attentional allocation, suggesting a critical role for the thalamus not only in attentional selection but more generally in regulating information transmission across the visual cortex.},

The full model includes a model for a specialized class of high-threshold thalamocortical cells (HTC cells), which burst at the alpha frequency at depolarized membrane potentials ({$\sim{}-$}56 mV). Our model generates alpha activity when the actions of either muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) agonists on thalamic reticular (RE), thalamocortical (TC), and HTC cells are mimicked. In our model of mGluR1-induced alpha, TC cells are equally likely to fire during any phase of alpha, consistent with in vitro experiments. By contrast, in our model of mAChR-induced alpha, TC cells tend to fire either at the peak or the trough of alpha, depending on conditions. Our modeling suggests that low levels of mGluR1 activation on a background of mAChR agonists may be able to initiate alpha activity that biases TC cells to fire at certain phases of alpha, offering a pathway for cortical control. If we introduce a strong stimulus by increasing the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to TC cells, an increase in alpha power is needed to mimic the level of phasing of TC cells observed in vivo. This increased alpha power reduces the probability that TC cells spike near the trough of alpha. We suggest that mAChR-induced alpha may contribute to grouping TC activity into discrete perceptual units for processing, whereas mGluR1-induced alpha may serve the purpose of blocking unwanted stimuli from reaching the cortex.},

Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

To explore the contribution of the dorsolateral PFC to flexible rule-based behavior, we recorded the activity of cells in this region of monkeys performing a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) analog. The monkey had to match a sample to one of three test items by either color or shape. Liquid reward and a discrete visual signal (error signal) were given as feedback to correct and incorrect target selections, respectively. The relevant rule and its frequent changes were not cued, and the monkeys could find it only by interpreting the feedback. In one-third of cells, cellular activity was modulated by the relevant rule, both throughout the trial and between trials. The magnitude of the modulation correlated with the number of errors that the monkeys committed after each rule change in the course of reestablishing high performance. Activity of other cells differed between correct and error trials independently from the rule-related modulation. This difference appeared during actual responses and before the monkeys faced the problems. Many PFC cells responded to the error-signal presentation, and, in some of them, the magnitude of response depended on the relevant rule. These results suggest that the dorsolateral PFC contributes to WCST performance by maintaining the relevant rule across trials, assessing behavioral outcomes, and monitoring the processes that could lead to success and failure in individual trials.},

In the attention task, only visual and visuomovement FEF neurons showed enhanced responses, whereas movement cells were unchanged. Importantly, visual, but not movement or visuomovement cells, showed enhanced gamma frequency synchronization with activity in V4 during attention.

This activity may play a role in controlling information flow among connected regions, allowing the brain's connectivity structure to be flexibly reconfigured in response to changing task demands. We have used a computational model to investigate the conditions under which oscillations can generate selective communication through a mechanism in which the excitability of neurons in one region is modulated coherently with a firing rate oscillation in another region. Our results demonstrate that this mechanism is able to accurately and selectively control the flow of signals encoded as spatial patterns of firing rate. However, we found that the requirement to avoid interference between different signals imposes previously unrecognised constraints on the structures of oscillatory activity that can efficiently support this mechanism. These constraints may be an organizing principle for the structured oscillatory activity observed in vivo.},

However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation and disbanding of cell assemblies and temporal evolution of cell assembly sequences are not well understood. I introduce and review three interconnected topics, which could facilitate progress in defining cell assemblies, identifying their neuronal organization, and revealing causal relationships between assembly organization and behavior. First, I hypothesize that cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product, as detected by ``reader-actuator'' mechanisms. Second, I suggest that the hierarchical organization of cell assemblies may be regarded as a neural syntax. Third, constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights (``synapsembles''). The existing support for this tripartite framework is reviewed and strategies for experimental testing of its predictions are discussed.},

They can be generated by excitation of populations of mutually inhibitory, interconnected interneurons. Such oscillations can entrain the firing patterns of excitatory projection neurons and have been shown both to facilitate the synchronization of spatially separate populations of neurons and mediate changes in synaptic strength that alter the ability of populations to synchronize. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations also act as a powerfully selective gate for trains of afferent inputs to an oscillating area, based on the `precise timing of inputs' as opposed to their absolute magnitude or frequency.},

  abstract = {Cortical neurons are typically driven by thousands of synaptic inputs. The arrival of a spike from one input may or may not be correlated with the arrival of other spikes from different inputs. How does this interdependence alter the probability that the postsynaptic neuron will fire? We constructed a simple random walk model in which the membrane potential of a target neuron fluctuates stochastically, driven by excitatory and inhibitory spikes arriving at random times. An analytic expression was derived for the mean output firing rate as a function of the firing rates and pairwise correlations of the inputs. This stochastic model made three quantitative predictions. (1) Correlations between pairs of excitatory or inhibitory inputs increase the fluctuations in synaptic drive, whereas correlations between excitatory\textendash{}inhibitory pairs decrease them. (2) When excitation and inhibition are fully balanced (the mean net synaptic drive is zero), firing is caused by the fluctuations only. (3) In the balanced case, firing is irregular. These theoretical predictions were in excellent agreement with simulations of an integrate-and-fire neuron that included multiple conductances and received hundreds of synaptic inputs. The results show that, in the balanced regime, weak correlations caused by signals shared among inputs may have a multiplicative effect on the input-output rate curve of a postsynaptic neuron, i.e. they may regulate its gain; in the unbalanced regime, correlations may increase firing probability mainly around threshold, when output rate is low; and in all cases correlations are expected to increase the variability of the output spike train.},

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input\textendash{}output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

We found that ACC neurons had a higher level of task selectivity than PFC neurons during the preparatory period on trials immediately following a task switch. In ACC neurons, task selectivity was strongest after the task switch and declined throughout the task block, whereas task selectivity remained constant in the PFC. These results demonstrate that the ACC is recruited when cognitive demands increase and suggest a role for both areas in task maintenance and the implementation of top-down control.},

  abstract = {Accomplishing even simple tasks depend on neuronal circuits to configure how incoming sensory stimuli map onto responses. Controlling these stimulus-response (SR) mapping rules relies on a cognitive control network comprising the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Single neurons within the ACC convey information about currently relevant SR mapping rules and signal unexpected action outcomes, which can be used to optimize behavioral choices. However, its functional significance and the mechanistic means of interaction with other nodes of the cognitive control network remain elusive and poorly understood. Here, we report that core aspects of cognitive control are encoded by rhythmic theta-band activity within neuronal circuits in the ACC. Throughout task performance, theta-activity predicted which of two SR mapping rules will be established before processing visual target information. Task-selective theta-activity emerged particularly early during those trials, which required the adjustment of SR rules following an erroneous rule representation in the preceding trial. These findings demonstrate a functional correlation of cognitive control processes and oscillatory theta-band activity in macaque ACC. Moreover, we report that spike output of a subset of cells in ACC is synchronized to predictive theta-activity, suggesting that the theta-cycle could serve as a temporal reference for coordinating local task selective computations across a larger network of frontal areas and the hippocampus to optimize and adjust the processing routes of sensory and motor circuits to achieve efficient sensory-motor control.},

  volume = {4},
  abstract = {Theta activity reflects a state of rhythmic modulation of excitability at the level of single neuron membranes, within local neuronal groups and between distant nodes of a neuronal network. A wealth of evidence has shown that during theta states distant neuronal groups synchronize, forming networks of spatially confined neuronal clusters at specific time periods during task performance. Here, we show that a functional commonality of networks engaging in theta rhythmic states is that they emerge around decision points, reflecting rhythmic synchronization of choice-relevant information. Decision points characterize a point in time shortly before a subject chooses to select one action over another, i.e., when automatic behavior is terminated and the organism reactivates multiple sources of information to evaluate the evidence for available choices. As such, decision processes require the coordinated retrieval of choice-relevant information including (i) the retrieval of stimulus evaluations (stimulus\textendash{}reward associations) and reward expectancies about future outcomes, (ii) the retrieval of past and prospective memories (e.g., stimulus\textendash{}stimulus associations), (iii) the reactivation of contextual task rule representations (e.g., stimulus\textendash{}response mappings), along with (iv) an ongoing assessment of sensory evidence. An increasing number of studies reveal that retrieval of these multiple types of information proceeds within few theta cycles through synchronized spiking activity across limbic, striatal, and cortical processing nodes. The outlined evidence suggests that evolving spatially and temporally specific theta synchronization could serve as the critical correlate underlying the selection of a choice during goal-directed behavior.},

  abstract = {Errors indicate the need to adjust attention for improved future performance. Detecting errors is thus a fundamental step to adjust and control attention. These functions have been associated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), predicting that dACC cells should track the specific processing states giving rise to errors in order to identify which processing aspects need readjustment. Here, we tested this prediction by recording cells in the dACC and lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC) of macaques performing an attention task that dissociated 3 processing stages. We found that, across prefrontal subareas, the dACC contained the largest cell populations encoding errors indicating (1) failures of inhibitory control of the attentional focus, (2) failures to prevent bottom-up distraction, and (3) lapses when implementing a choice. Error-locked firing in the dACC showed the earliest latencies across the PFC, emerged earlier than reward omission signals, and involved a significant proportion of putative inhibitory interneurons. Moreover, early onset error-locked response enhancement in the dACC was followed by transient prefrontal-cingulate inhibition, possibly reflecting active disengagement from task processing. These results suggest a functional specialization of the dACC to track and identify the actual processes that give rise to erroneous task outcomes, emphasizing its role to control attentional performance.},

  abstract = {Propofol, like most general anesthetic drugs, can induce both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) manifestations of excitation, rather than sedation, at low doses. Neuronal excitation is unexpected in the presence of this GABAA-potentiating drug. We construct a series of network models to understand this paradox. Individual neurons have ion channel conductances with Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley-type formulations. Propofol increases the maximal conductance and time constant of decay of the synaptic GABAA current. Networks range in size from 2 to 230 neurons. Population output is measured as a function of pyramidal cell activity, with the electroencephalogram approximated by the sum of population AMPA activity between pyramidal cells.
These model networks suggest propofol-induced paradoxical excitation may result from a membrane level interaction between the GABAA current and an intrinsic membrane slow potassium current (M-current). This membrane level interaction has consequences at the level of multicellular networks enabling a switch from baseline interneuron synchrony to propofol-induced interneuron antisynchrony. Large network models reproduce the clinical EEG changes characteristic of propofol-induced paradoxical excitation. The EEG changes coincide with the emergence of antisynchronous interneuron clusters in the model networks. Our findings suggest interneuron antisynchrony as a potential network mechanism underlying the generation of propofol-induced paradoxical excitation. As correlates of behavioral phenomenology, these networks may refine our understanding of the specific behavioral states associated with general anesthesia.},

Such communication is achieved in part through temporal structuring of neuronal activity by population rhythms, particularly in the beta and gamma frequency ranges (12\textendash{}80\,Hz). Here we demonstrate, using in vitro and in silico models, that spectrally identical patterns of beta2 and gamma rhythms are generated in primary sensory areas and polymodal association areas by fundamentally different local circuit mechanisms: Glutamatergic excitation induced beta2 frequency population rhythms only in layer 5 association cortex whereas cholinergic neuromodulation induced this rhythm only in layer 5 primary sensory cortex. This region-specific sensitivity of local circuits to cholinergic modulation allowed for control of the extent of cortical temporal interactions. Furthermore, the contrasting mechanisms underlying these beta2 rhythms produced a high degree of directionality, favouring an influence of association cortex over primary auditory cortex.},

  abstract = {Understanding the principles governing the dynamic coordination of functional brain networks remains an important unmet goal within neuroscience. How do distributed ensembles of neurons transiently coordinate their activity across a variety of spatial and temporal scales? While a complete mechanistic account of this process remains elusive, evidence suggests that neuronal oscillations may play a key role in this process, with different rhythms influencing both local computation and long-range communication. To investigate this question, we recorded multiple single unit and local field potential (LFP) activity from microelectrode arrays implanted bilaterally in macaque motor areas. Monkeys performed a delayed center-out reach task either manually using their natural arm (Manual Control, MC) or under direct neural control through a brain-machine interface (Brain Control, BC). In accord with prior work, we found that the spiking activity of individual neurons is coupled to multiple aspects of the ongoing motor beta rhythm (10\textendash{}45 Hz) during both MC and BC, with neurons exhibiting a diversity of coupling preferences. However, here we show that for identified single neurons, this beta-to-rate mapping can change in a reversible and task-dependent way. For example, as beta power increases, a given neuron may increase spiking during MC but decrease spiking during BC, or exhibit a reversible shift in the preferred phase of firing. The within-task stability of coupling, combined with the reversible cross-task changes in coupling, suggest that task-dependent changes in the beta-to-rate mapping play a role in the transient functional reorganization of neural ensembles. We characterize the range of task-dependent changes in the mapping from beta amplitude, phase, and inter-hemispheric phase differences to the spike rates of an ensemble of simultaneously-recorded neurons, and discuss the potential implications that dynamic remapping from oscillatory activity to spike rate and timing may hold for models of computation and communication in distributed functional brain networks., How is the functional role of a particular neuron established within an ensemble? The concept of a neural tuning curve \textendash{} the mapping from input variables such as movement direction to output firing rate \textendash{} has proven useful in investigating neural function. However, prior work shows that tuning curves are not fixed but may be remapped as a function of task demands \textendash{} presumably via high-level mechanisms of cognitive control. How is this accomplished? Brain rhythms may play a causal role in this process, but the coupling of single cells to network activity remains poorly understood. We investigated the coupling between rhythmic beta activity and spiking as macaques performed two different tasks. This coupling can be described in terms of a function that maps oscillatory amplitude and phase to instantaneous spike rate. Similarly to direction tuning, this ``internal'' tuning curve also exhibits task-dependent changes. We characterize these changes across a large ensemble of simultaneously-recorded cells, and consider some of the neuro-computational implications presented by cross-level coupling between single cells and large-scale networks. In particular, relative to the slow time-scale of behavior, the observed beta-to-rate mappings may prove useful for modulating winner-take-all dynamics on intermediate time-scales and relative spike timing on fast time-scales.},

Specific cognitive and motor states are associated with oscillations in discrete frequency bands within this range, but it is not known whether interactions and transitions between distinct frequencies are of functional importance. When coexpressed rhythms have frequencies that differ by a factor of two or more interactions can be seen in terms of phase synchronization. Larger frequency differences can result in interactions in the form of nesting of faster frequencies within slower ones by a process of amplitude modulation. It is not known how coexpressed rhythms, whose frequencies differ by less than a factor of two may interact. Here we show that two frequencies (gamma \textendash{} 40\,Hz and beta2 \textendash{} 25\,Hz), coexpressed in superficial and deep cortical laminae with low temporal interaction, can combine to generate a third frequency (beta1 \textendash{} 15\,Hz) showing strong temporal interaction. The process occurs via period concatenation, with basic rhythm-generating microcircuits underlying gamma and beta2 rhythms forming the building blocks of the beta1 rhythm by a process of addition. The mean ratio of adjacent frequency components was a constant \textendash{} approximately the golden mean \textendash{} which served to both minimize temporal interactions, and permit multiple transitions, between frequencies.

This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1 (12\textendash{}20 Hz), beta 2 (20\textendash{}30 Hz) and gamma (30\textendash{}80 Hz). The pharmacological profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct effects on GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed both common denominators for oscillation generation and function, and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks, and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate. This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations, and mathematical analysis.},

  abstract = {Neocortical networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can display alpha({$\alpha$})-frequency rhythms when an animal is in a resting or unfocused state. Unlike some {$\gamma$}- and {$\beta$}-frequency rhythms, experimental observations in cats have shown that these {$\alpha$}-frequency rhythms need not synchronize over long cortical distances. Here, we develop a network model of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory cells to study this asynchrony. The cells of the local circuit are modeled on the neurons found in layer V of the neocortex where {$\alpha$}-frequency rhythms are thought to originate. Cortical distance is represented by a pair of local circuits coupled with a delay in synaptic propagation. Mathematical analysis of this model reveals that the h and T currents present in layer V pyramidal (excitatory) cells not only produce and regulate the {$\alpha$}-frequency rhythm but also lead to the occurrence of spatial asynchrony. In particular, these inward currents cause excitation and inhibition to have nonintuitive effects in the network, with excitation delaying and inhibition advancing the firing time of cells; these reversed effects create the asynchrony. Moreover, increased excitatory to excitatory connections can lead to further desynchronization. However, the local rhythms have the property that, in the absence of excitatory to excitatory connections, if the participating cells are brought close to synchrony (for example, by common input), they will remain close to synchrony for a substantial time.},

The model consists of synaptically-coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons and supports rhythmic activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. We find that the effects of neuromodulation on ionic conductances are, by themselves, sufficient to induce transitions between synchronous gamma and beta rhythms and asynchronous alpha rhythms. Moreover, these changes are consistent with changes in behavioral state, with the rhythm transitioning from the slower alpha to the faster gamma and beta as arousal increases. We also observe that it is the same set of underlying intrinsic and network mechanisms that appear to be simultaneously responsible for both the observed transitions between the rhythm types and between their synchronization properties. Spike time response curves (STRCs) are used to study the relationship between the transitions in rhythm and the underlying biophysics.},

  abstract = {1. We used simulations of the in vitro CA3 region of the hippocampus to analyse the 5 Hz population oscillations recorded experimentally in carbachol. 2. A simulation model of the in vitro CA3 region was constructed with 1000 pyramidal neurones and 200 inhibitory neurones (100 producing fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and 100 producing slow IPSPs of delayed onset). Each neurone contained nineteen soma-dendritic compartments. Pyramidal neurones contained six voltage- and/or calcium-dependent ionic currents, whose kinetics were consistent with voltage-clamp data. The connectivity and waveform of unitary synaptic events for excitatory and fast inhibitory synapses were consistent with dual intracellular recordings. This network was shown to generate previously described network oscillations, including synchronized bursts recorded in the presence of GABAA blockers, and synchronized synaptic potentials observed during partial blockade of GABAA inhibition. 3. The model generated 5 Hz oscillations as recorded in carbachol under the following conditions: (a) excitatory synaptic conductance was within a limited range; (b) there was blockade of fast and slow IPSPs (consistent with the experimental lack of effect of bicuculline and phaclofen on carbachol oscillations and the known depression of IPSPs by acetylcholine); (c) the after hyperpolarization (AHP) conductance was reduced (consistent with the known pharmacology of carbachol); (d) the apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells were depolarized, as suggested by the carbachol-induced depolarization of pyramidal neurones. Each oscillation was associated in pyramidal cells with a burst of action potentials riding on a depolarizing wave. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of excitatory synapse was not necessary for the oscillations to occur. 4. Progressive reduction of excitatory synaptic strength led to an oscillation of the same frequency, with bursts riding on smaller EPSPs (consistent with the experiment). Further reduction of excitatory synaptic strength abolished the population oscillation by uncoupling the neurones. When excitatory synaptic conductance was too large, population oscillations were attenuated as the cells switched from a bursting mode to a repetitively firing mode. 5. Increasing the AHP conductance prolonged the interburst interval as expected. Inclusion of slow IPSPs exerted a similar effect. 6. When fast IPSPs were included, an oscillation with different characteristics emerged: a 10 Hz oscillation that was gated by compound GABAA IPSPs. On any oscillatory wave, few pyramidal neurones fired, and the firing of individual neurones was irregular.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been associated with diverse functions including attentional processes, visceromotor activity, decision making, goal directed behavior, and working memory. Using retrograde tracing techniques, we examined, compared, and contrasted afferent projections to the four divisions of the mPFC in the rat: the medial (frontal) agranular (AGm), anterior cingulate (AC), prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) cortices. Each division of the mPFC receives a unique set of afferent projections. There is a shift dorsoventrally along the mPFC from predominantly sensorimotor input to the dorsal mPFC (AGm and dorsal AC) to primarily `limbic' input to the ventral mPFC (PL and IL). The AGm and dorsal AC receive afferent projections from widespread areas of the cortex (and associated thalamic nuclei) representing all sensory modalities. This information is presumably integrated at, and utilized by, the dorsal mPFC in goal directed actions. In contrast with the dorsal mPFC, the ventral mPFC receives significantly less cortical input overall and afferents from limbic as opposed to sensorimotor regions of cortex. The main sources of afferent projections to PL/IL are from the orbitomedial prefrontal, agranular insular, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, the hippocampus, the claustrum, the medial basal forebrain, the basal nuclei of amygdala, the midline thalamus and monoaminergic nuclei of the brainstem. With a few exceptions, there are few projections from the hypothalamus to the dorsal or ventral mPFC. Accordingly, subcortical limbic information mainly reaches the mPFC via the midline thalamus and basal nuclei of amygdala. As discussed herein, based on patterns of afferent (as well as efferent) projections, PL is positioned to serve a direct role in cognitive functions homologous to dorsolateral PFC of primates, whereas IL appears to represent a visceromotor center homologous to the orbitomedial PFC of primates.},

  abstract = {Thalamic relay nuclei transmit basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex, forming the last link in corticobasal ganglia circuitry. The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating ``feedforward'' loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([3H]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA\textendash{}VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA\textendash{}VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits.},

  abstract = {The prefrontal cortex projects to many thalamic nuclei, in pathways associated with cognition, emotion, and action. We investigated how multiple projection systems to the thalamus are organized in prefrontal cortex after injection of distinct retrograde tracers in the principal mediodorsal (MD), the limbic anterior medial (AM), and the motor-related ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Neurons projecting to these nuclei were organized in interdigitated modules extending vertically within layers VI and V. Projection neurons were also organized in layers. The majority of projection neurons to MD or AM originated in layer VI ({$\sim$}80\%), but a significant proportion ({$\sim$}20\%) originated in layer V. In contrast, prefrontal neurons projecting to VA/VL were equally distributed in layers V and VI. Neurons directed to VA/VL occupied mostly the upper part of layer V, while neurons directed to MD or AM occupied mostly the deep part of layer V. The highest proportions of projection neurons in layer V to each nucleus were found in dorsal and medial prefrontal areas. The laminar organization of prefrontal cortico-thalamic projections differs from sensory systems, where projections originate predominantly or entirely from layer VI. Previous studies indicate that layer V cortico-thalamic neurons innervate through some large terminals thalamic neurons that project widely to superficial cortical layers. The large population of prefrontal projection neurons in layer V may drive thalamic neurons, triggering synchronization by recruiting several cortical areas through widespread thalamo-cortical projections to layer I. These pathways may underlie the synthesis of cognition, emotion and action.},

  abstract = {Cortical areas are linked through pathways which originate and terminate in specific layers. The factors underlying which layers are involved in specific connections are not well understood. Here we tested whether cortical structure can predict the pattern as well as the relative distribution of projection neurons and axonal terminals in cortical layers, studied with retrograde and anterograde tracers. We used the prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey as a model system because their laminar organization varies systematically, ranging from areas that have only three identifiable layers, to those that have six layers. We rated each prefrontal area based on the number and definition of its cortical layers (level 1, lowest; level 5, highest). The structural model accurately predicted the laminar pattern of connections in approximately 80\% of the cases. Thus, projection neurons from a higher-level cortex originated mostly in the upper layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the deep layers (4-6) of a lower-level cortex. Conversely, most projection neurons from a lower-level area originated in the deep layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the upper layers (1-3) of a higher-level area. In addition, the structural model accurately predicted that the proportion of projection neurons or axonal terminals in the upper to the deep layers would vary as a function of the number of levels between the connected cortices. The power of this structural model lies in its potential to predict patterns of connections in the human cortex, where invasive procedures are precluded.},

  abstract = {The prefrontal cortex encompasses a large and heterogeneous set of areas, whose borders have been variously mapped in different architectonic studies. Differences in cortical maps present a formidable problem in comparing data across studies and in constructing databanks on the connections and functional attributes of cortical areas. Here we used quantitative approaches to cortical mapping to investigate (i) if architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex in adult rhesus monkeys have unique profiles and (ii) if groups of architectonic areas belonging to distinct cortical types, ranging from agranular to eulaminate, have similar features. In addition, we used multidimensional analyses to see if, and how, prefrontal areas form clusters when multiple features are considered simultaneously. We used quantitative unbiased sampling procedures to estimate the areal and laminar density of neurons, glia and neurons positive for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR) among 21 prefrontal areas or subdivisions of areas. Neuronal density varied among the prefrontal cortices (range: 38 569 {$\pm$} 4078 to 58 708 {$\pm$} 2327 neurons/mm3); it was lowest in caudal orbitofrontal and medial areas (OPAll, OPro, 13, 24a, 32, M25) and highest in lateral prefrontal areas (subdivisions of areas 46 and 8). Neurons positive for PV were most prevalent in lateral prefrontal areas and least prevalent in caudal orbitofrontal and medial pre-frontal areas, whereas the opposite trend was noted for neurons that expressed CB. Neurons positive for CR did not show regional differences, and the density of glia showed small variations among prefrontal cortices. The differences among areas, along with differences in the thickness of individual areas and layers, were used to establish a quantitative profile for each area. The results showed that differences in the density of neurons, and the preponderance of neurons positive for PV and CB, were related to different architectonic types of areas found within the prefrontal cortex. Conventional as well as multiparameter statistical analyses distinguished at one extreme the agranular and dysgranular (limbic) cortices, which were characterized by prominent deep layers (V\textendash{}VI), the lowest neuronal density, the highest ratio of glia/neurons, and the lowest density of PV and the highest for CB. At the other extreme, lateral eulaminate cortices were characterized by the highest density of neurons, a prominent granular layer IV, denser supragranular (II\textendash{}III) than infragranular (V\textendash{}VI) layers, and a balanced distribution of neurons positive for PV and CB. The results provide insights into potentially different rates of development or maturation of limbic and eulaminate prefrontal areas, and their differential vulnerability in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The quantitative methods used provide an objective approach to construct maps, address differences in nomenclature across studies, establish homologies in different species and provide a baseline to identify changes in pathologic conditions.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Pathways linking the thalamus and cortex mediate our daily shifts from states of attention to quiet rest, or sleep, yet little is known about their architecture in high-order neural systems associated with cognition, emotion and action. We provide novel evidence for neurochemical and synaptic specificity of two complementary circuits linking one such system, the prefrontal cortex with the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus in primates. One circuit originated from the neurochemical group of parvalbumin-positive thalamic neurons and projected focally through large terminals to the middle cortical layers, resembling `drivers' in sensory pathways. Parvalbumin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by small `modulatory' type cortical terminals, forming asymmetric (presumed excitatory) synapses at thalamic sites enriched with the specialized metabotropic glutamate receptors. A second circuit had a complementary organization: it originated from the neurochemical group of calbindin-positive thalamic neurons and terminated through small `modulatory' terminals over long distances in the superficial prefrontal layers. Calbindin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by prefrontal axons through small and large terminals that formed asymmetric synapses preferentially at sites with ionotropic glutamate receptors, consistent with a driving pathway. The largely parallel thalamo-cortical pathways terminated among distinct and laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons that differ markedly in inhibitory control. The balance of activation of these parallel circuits that link a high-order association cortex with the thalamus may allow shifts to different states of consciousness, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.},

This book shows how to look at ways of visualizing large datasets, whether large in numbers of cases or large in numbers of variables or large in both. Data visualization is useful for data cleaning, exploring data, identifying trends and clusters, spotting local patterns, evaluating modeling output, and presenting results. It is essential for exploratory data analysis and data mining.

  abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been the subject of intense interest as a locus of cognitive control. Several computational models have been proposed to account for a range of effects, including error detection, conflict monitoring, error likelihood prediction, and numerous other effects observed with single-unit neurophysiology, fMRI, and lesion studies. Here, we review the state of computational models of cognitive control and offer a new theoretical synthesis of the mPFC as signaling response\textendash{}outcome predictions. This new synthesis has two interacting components. The first component learns to predict the various possible outcomes of a planned action, and the second component detects discrepancies between the actual and intended responses; the detected discrepancies in turn update the outcome predictions. This single construct is consistent with a wide array of performance monitoring effects in mPFC and suggests a unifying account of the cognitive role of medial PFC in performance monitoring.},

  issn = {1047-3211, 1460-2199},
  abstract = {The capacity to rapidly adjust behavioral strategies according to changing task demands is closely associated with coordinated activity in lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Subdivisions within prefrontal cortex are implicated to encode attentional task sets and to update changing task rules, particularly when changing task demands require top-down control. Here, we tested whether these top-down processes precede stimulus processing and constitute a preparatory attentional state that functionally couples with parietal cortex. We examined this functional coupling by recording from intracranial EEG electrodes in macaques during performance of a task-switching paradigm that separates task performance that is based on controlled top-down guidance from automatic, stimulus-triggered processing modes. We identify a prefrontal-parietal network that phase synchronizes at 5\textendash{}10 Hz, particularly during preparatory states that indicate top-down controlled task-processing modes. Phase relations in the network suggest that medial and lateral prefrontal cortices synchronize bidirectionally, with medial prefrontal cortex showing a phase-lead relative to left parietal recorded 5- to 10-Hz preparatory signals. These findings reveal a 5- to 10-Hz coordinated, long-range fronto-parietal network prior to actual task-relevant stimulus processing, particularly when subjects engage in controlled task processing modes.},

  abstract = {Sequential activity is seen in the hippocampus during multiple network patterns, prominently as replay activity during both awake and sleep sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), and as theta sequences during active exploration. Although various mnemonic and cognitive functions have been ascribed to these hippocampal sequences, evidence for these proposed functions remains primarily phenomenological. Here, we briefly review current knowledge about replay events and theta sequences in spatial memory tasks. We reason that in order to gain a mechanistic and causal understanding of how these patterns influence memory and cognitive processing, it is important to consider how these sequences influence activity in other regions, and in particular, the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for memory-guided behavior. For spatial memory tasks, we posit that hippocampal-prefrontal interactions mediated by replay and theta sequences play complementary and overlapping roles at different stages in learning, supporting memory encoding and retrieval, deliberative decision making, planning, and guiding future actions. This framework offers testable predictions for future physiology and closed-loop feedback inactivation experiments for specifically targeting hippocampal sequences as well as coordinated prefrontal activity in different network states, with the potential to reveal their causal roles in memory-guided behavior.},

Recent studies on the interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex have greatly advanced our understanding of the physiological bases of these memory processes. Although hippocampalprefrontal network activity differs in many aspects during waking and sleep states, here we review evidence that hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) emerge as a common neurophysiological pattern in both states, facilitating communication between these two regions via coordinated reactivation of stored memory information. We further consider whether sleep and awake reactivation mediate similar memory processes or have different mnemonic functions, and the mechanistic role of this cross-regional dialogue in learning and memory. Finally, we provide an integrated view of how these two forms of reactivation might work together to support spatial learning and memory.},

Chains of ripples (ripple bursts) in CA1 have been reported to co-occur with long-range place cell sequence replays during the quiet awake state, but roles of neural inputs to CA1 in ripple bursts and replays are unknown. Here we show that ripple bursts in CA1 and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are temporally associated. An inhibition of MECIII input to CA1 during quiet awake reduced ripple bursts in CA1 and restricted the spatial coverage of replays to a shorter distance corresponding to single ripple events. The reduction did not occur with MECIII input inhibition during slowwave sleep. Inhibition of CA3 activity suppressed ripples and replays in CA1 regardless of behavioral state. Thus, MECIII input to CA1 is crucial for ripple bursts and long-range replays specifically in quiet awake, whereas CA3 input is essential for both, regardless of behavioral state.},

Yet it remains to be investigated whether these functions are temporally segregated, occurring during different behavioral states. During a self-paced spatial task, awake hippocampal replay occurring either immediately before movement toward a reward location or just after arrival at a reward location preferentially involved cells consistent with the current trajectory. In contrast, during periods of extended immobility, no such biases were evident. Notably, the occurrence of task-focused reactivations predicted the accuracy of subsequent spatial decisions. Additionally, during immobility, but not periods preceding or succeeding movement, grid cells in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex replayed coherently with the hippocampus. Thus, hippocampal reactivations dynamically and abruptly switch between operational modes in response to task demands, plausibly moving from a state favoring navigational planning to one geared toward memory consolidation.},

During the memory retention period, a transient burst of high gamma synchronization preceded an animal's correct choice in both prospective planning and retrospective mistake correction, but not an animal's incorrect choice. Optogenetic inhibition of the circuit targeted to the choice point area resulted in a coordinated reduction in both high gamma synchrony and correct execution of a working-memory-guided behavior. These findings suggest that transient high gamma synchrony contributes to the successful execution of spatial working memory. Furthermore, our data are consistent with an association between transient high gamma synchrony and explicit awareness of the working memory content.},

Across different environments, however, hippocampal maps are randomized, making it unclear how goal locations could be encoded consistently. To address this question, we developed a virtual reality task with shifting reward contingencies to distinguish place versus reward encoding. In mice performing the task, large-scale recordings in CA1 and subiculum revealed a small, specialized cell population that was only active near reward yet whose activity could not be explained by sensory cues or stereotyped reward anticipation behavior. Across different virtual environments, most cells remapped randomly, but reward encoding consistently arose from a single pool of cells, suggesting that they formed a dedicated channel for reward. These observations represent a significant departure from the current understanding of CA1 as a relatively homogeneous ensemble without fixed coding properties and provide a new candidate for the cellular basis of goal memory in the hippocampus.},

Furthermore, within such REM episodes behavior-dependent modulation of the subcortically driven theta rhythm is also reproduced. These results demonstrate that long temporal sequences of patterned multineuronal activity suggestive of episodic memory traces are reactivated during REM sleep. Such reactivation may be important for memory processing and provides a basis for the electrophysiological examination of the content of dream states.},

In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not `smooth across' boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of GAMs, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via GCV, AIC or REML, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20\textendash{}40 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of CA1 and CA3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in CA1 and CA3 regions during SPW-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer SPW-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of SPW-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation.},

  abstract = {Most conventional spatial smoothers smooth with respect to the Euclidean distance between observations, even though this distance may not be a meaningful measure of spatial proximity, especially when boundary features are present. When domains have complicated boundaries leakage (the inappropriate linking of parts of the domain which are separated by physical barriers) can occur. To overcome this problem, we develop a method of smoothing with respect to generalized distances, such as within domain distances. We obtain the generalized distances between our points and then use multidimensional scaling to find a configuration of our observations in a Euclidean space of 2 or more dimensions, such that the Euclidian distances between points in that space closely approximate the generalized distances between the points. Smoothing is performed over this new point configuration, using a conventional smoother. To mitigate the problems associated with smoothing in high dimensions we use a generalization of thin plate spline smoothers proposed by Duchon (Constructive theory of functions of several variables, pp 85\textendash{}100, 1977). This general method for smoothing with respect to generalized distances improves on the performance of previous within-domain distance spatial smoothers, and often provides a more natural model than the soap film approach of Wood et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser B Stat Methodol 70(5):931\textendash{}955, 2008). The smoothers are of the linear basis with quadratic penalty type easily incorporated into a range of statistical models.},

  volume = {263},
  issn = {01650270},
  abstract = {Background: Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information about the environment during navigation. Computational methods have been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity. New method: We extend our previous work and propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to infer rat hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model selection problem, we leverage a Bayesian nonparametric model. Specifically, we apply a hierarchical Dirichlet processhidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on variational Bayes (VB).
Results: The effectiveness of our Bayesian approaches is demonstrated on recordings from a freely behaving rat navigating in an open field environment.
Comparison with existing methods: The HDP-HMM outperforms the finite-state HMM in both simulated and experimental data. For HPD-HMM, the MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes.
Conclusion: The Bayesian nonparametric HDP-HMM method can efficiently perform model selection and identify model parameters, which can used for modeling latent-state neuronal population dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In comparison with an optimized quad-core central processing unit (CPU) implementation, our approach achieves an \$20- to 50-fold increase in speed in eight tested rat hippocampal, cortical, and thalamic ensemble recordings, with real-time decoding speed (approximately fraction of a millisecond per spike) and scalability up to thousands of channels. By accommodating parallel shuffling in real time (computation time {$<$}15 ms), our approach enables assessment of the statistical significance of onlinedecoded ``memory replay'' candidates during quiet wakefulness or sleep. This open-source software toolkit supports the decoding of spatial correlates or content-triggered experimental manipulation in closed-loop neuroscience experiments.},

  volume = {94},
  issn = {09507051},
  abstract = {To gain a better understanding of how neural ensembles communicate and process information, neural decoding algorithms are used to extract information encoded in their spiking activity. Bayesian decoding is one of the most used neural population decoding approaches to extract information from the ensemble spiking activity of rat hippocampal neurons. Recently it has been shown how Bayesian decoding can be implemented without the intermediate step of sorting spike waveforms into groups of single units. Here we extend the approach in order to make it suitable for online encoding/decoding scenarios that require real-time decoding such as brain-machine interfaces. We propose an online algorithm for the Bayesian decoding that reduces the time required for decoding neural populations, resulting in a real-time capable decoding framework. More specifically, we improve the speed of the probability density estimation step, which is the most essential and the most expensive computation of the spike-sorting-less decoding process, by developing a kernel density compression algorithm. In contrary to existing online kernel compression techniques, rather than optimizing for the minimum estimation error caused by kernels compression, the proposed method compresses kernels on the basis of the distance between the merging component and its most similar neighbor. Thus, without costly optimization, the proposed method has very low compression latency with a small and manageable estimation error. In addition, the proposed bandwidth matching method for Gaussian kernels merging has an interesting mathematical property whereby optimization in the estimation of the probability density function can be performed efficiently, resulting in a faster decoding speed. We successfully applied the proposed kernel compression algorithm to the Bayesian decoding framework to reconstruct positions of a freely moving rat from hippocampal unsorted spikes, with significant improvements in the decoding speed and acceptable decoding error.},

The modeling approach exploits the connection of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process intensity with a density function. Nonparametric Dirichlet process mixtures for this density, combined with nonparametric or semiparametric modeling for the mark distribution, yield flexible prior models for the marked Poisson process. In particular, we focus on fully nonparametric model formulations that build the mark density and intensity function from a joint nonparametric mixture, and provide guidelines for straightforward application of these techniques. A key feature of such models is that they can yield flexible inference about the conditional distribution for multivariate marks without requiring specification of a complicated dependence scheme. We address issues relating to choice of the Dirichlet process mixture kernels, and develop methods for prior specification and posterior simulation for full inference about functionals of the marked Poisson process. Moreover, we discuss a method for model checking that can be used to assess and compare goodness of fit of different model specifications under the proposed framework.

However, the network mechanisms concurring to achieve this function are largely unknown. We designed a multi-compartmental model of the CA3-CA1 subfields to generate biophysically realistic ripple dynamics from the cellular level to local field potentials. Simulations broadly parallel in vivo observations and support that ripples emerge from CA1 pyramidal spiking paced by recurrent inhibition. In addition to ripple oscillations, key coordination mechanisms involve concomitant aspects of network activity. Recurrent synaptic interactions in CA1 exhibit slow-gamma band coherence with CA3 input, thus offering a way to coordinate CA1 activities with CA3 inducers. Moreover, CA1 feedback inhibition controls the content of spontaneous replay during CA1 ripples, forming new mnemonic representations through plasticity. These insights are consistent with slow-gamma interactions and interneuronal circuit plasticity observed in vivo, suggesting a multifaceted ripple-related replay phenomenon.},

It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals' behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable|the hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward\{backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are e cient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.\vphantom\}},

Stochastic filtering theory is briefly reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering. Following the Bayesian statistics, different Bayesian filtering techniques are developed given different scenarios. Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman filter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear filtering techniques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our attention on the Bayesian filtering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle filters. Many variants of the particle filter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail. In addition, some other (new) directions on Bayesian filtering are also explored.},

In these cases, we are limited to noisy observations of events associated with each node. To enable analysis of these implicit networks, we develop a probabilistic model that combines mutuallyexciting point processes with random graph models.

  abstract = {Neural circuits contain heterogeneous groups of neurons that differ in type, location, connectivity, and basic response properties. However, traditional methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering are ill-suited to recovering the structure underlying the organization of neural circuits. In particular, they do not take advantage of the rich temporal dependencies in multi-neuron recordings and fail to account for the noise in neural spike trains. Here we describe new tools for inferring latent structure from simultaneously recorded spike train data using a hierarchical extension of a multi-neuron point process model commonly known as the generalized linear model (GLM). Our approach combines the GLM with flexible graph-theoretic priors governing the relationship between latent features and neural connectivity patterns. Fully Bayesian inference via P{\'o}lya-gamma augmentation of the resulting model allows us to classify neurons and infer latent dimensions of circuit organization from correlated spike trains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with applications to synthetic data and multi-neuron recordings in primate retina, revealing latent patterns of neural types and locations from spike trains alone.},

In this paper, we propose two Bayesian nonparametric methods for this purpose: the Bayesian modeling allows to impose informative priors and constraints into the model, whereas Bayesian nonparametrics allows automatic model selection.

While there are many methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, existing techniques face a trade off between offering interpretable descriptions and making accurate predictions. Here, we develop a class of models that aims to achieve both simultaneously, smoothly interpolating between simple descriptions and more complex, yet also more accurate models1. Our probabilistic model achieves this multi-scale property through a hierarchy of locally linear dynamics that jointly approximate global nonlinear dynamics. We call it the tree-structured recurrent switching linear dynamical system. To fit this model, we present a fully-Bayesian sampling procedure using P{\'o}lya-Gamma data augmentation to allow for fast and conjugate Gibbs sampling.

Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time.},

Advances in recording technology provide access to an ever-larger fraction of the population, but the standard computational approaches available to identify the collective dynamics scale poorly with the size of the dataset. We describe a new, scalable approach to discovering low-dimensional dynamics that underlie simultaneously recorded spike trains from a neural population. We formulate the Recurrent Linear Model (RLM) by generalising the Kalman-filter-based likelihood calculation for latent linear dynamical systems to incorporate a generalised-linear observation process. We show that RLMs describe motor-cortical population data better than either directly-coupled generalised-linear models or latent linear dynamical system models with generalised-linear observations. We also introduce the cascaded generalised-linear model (CGLM) to capture low-dimensional instantaneous correlations in neural populations. The CGLM describes the cortical recordings better than either Ising or Gaussian models and, like the RLM, can be fit exactly and quickly. The CGLM can also be seen as a generalisation of a lowrank Gaussian model, in this case factor analysis. The computational tractability of the RLM and CGLM allow both to scale to very high-dimensional neural data.},

The method improves on the standard Kim smoothing approach by dispensing with one of the key approximations, thus making fuller use of the available future information. Whilst the central assumption required is projection to a mixture of Gaussians, we show that an additional conditional independence assumption results in a simpler but accurate alternative. Our method consists of a single Forward and Backward Pass and is reminiscent of the standard smoothing `correction' recursions in the simpler linear dynamical system. The method is numerically stable and compares favourably against alternative approximations, both in cases where a single mixture component provides a good posterior approximation, and where a multimodal approximation is required.},

These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models.},

  abstract = {Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for {$>$}10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic events into distinct dynamic regimes.

We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers of channels, (ii) asynchronous regimeswitching, and (iii) an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics. We demonstrate the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG data. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.},

Classical approaches to identification and estimation of these models assume a fixed, pre-specified number of dynamical models. We instead examine Bayesian nonparametric approaches that define a prior on Markov switching processes with an unbounded number of potential model parameters (i.e., Markov modes). By leveraging stochastic processes such as the beta and Dirichlet process, these methods allow the data to drive the complexity of the learned model, while still permitting efficient inference algorithms.

These brief events, often termed ``replay'' in the scientific literature, are largely confined to non-exploratory states such as sleep or quiet rest. Early studies examining the content of replay noted a strong correlation between the encoded spatial information and the animal's prior behavior; thus, replay was initially hypothesized to play a role in memory formation and/or systems-level consolidation via ``off-line'' reactivation of previous experiences. However, recent findings indicate that replay may also serve as a memory retrieval mechanism to guide future behavior or may be an incidental reflection of pre-existing network assemblies. Here, I will review what is known regarding the content of replay events and their correlation with past and future actions, and I will discuss how this knowledge might inform or constrain models which seek to explain the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these events and their role in mnemonic processes.},

We demonstrate this combined 3D imaging and machine learning method can be used to unmask potential strategies employed by the brain to adapt to the environment, to capture both predicted and previously hidden phenotypes caused by genetic or neural manipulations, and to systematically expose the global structure of behavior within an experiment. This work reveals that mouse body language is built from identifiable components and is organized in a predictable fashion; deciphering this language establishes an objective framework for characterizing the influence of environmental cues, genes and neural activity on behavior.},

  abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) have vastly used a single scale of neural activity, e.g., spikes or electrocorticography (ECoG), as their control signal. New technology allows for simultaneous recording of multiple scales of neural activity, from spikes to local field potentials (LFP) and ECoG. These advances introduce the new challenge of modeling and decoding multiple scales of neural activity jointly. Such multiscale decoding is challenging for two reasons. First, spikes are discrete-valued and ECoG/LFP are continuous-valued, resulting in fundamental differences in statistical characteristics. Second, the time-scales of these signals are different, with spikes having a millisecond time-scale and ECoG/LFP having much slower time-scales on the order of tens of milliseconds. Here we develop a new multiscale modeling and decoding framework that addresses these challenges. Our multiscale decoder extracts information from ECoG/LFP in addition to spikes, while operating at the fast time-scale of the spikes. The multiscale decoder specializes to a Kalman filter (KF) or to a point process filter (PPF) when no spikes or ECoG/LFP are available, respectively. Using closed-loop BMI simulations, we show that compared to PPF decoding of spikes alone or KF decoding of LFP/ECoG alone, the multiscale decoder significantly improves the accuracy and error performance of BMI control and runs at the fast millisecond time-scale of the spikes. This new multiscale modeling and decoding framework has the potential to improve BMI control using simultaneous multiscale neural activity.},

  abstract = {New recording technologies and the potential for closed-loop experiments have led to an increasing demand for computationally efficient and accurate algorithms to decode population spiking activity in multi-dimensional spaces. Exact point process filters can accurately decode low dimensional signals, but are computationally intractable for high dimensional signals. Approximate Gaussian filters are computationally efficient but are inaccurate when the signals have complex distributions and nonlinear dynamics. Even particle filter methods tend to become inefficient and inaccurate when the filter distribution has multiple peaks. Here we develop a new point process filter algorithm that combines the computational efficiency of approximate Gaussian methods with a numerical accuracy that exceeds standard particle filters. We use a mixture of Gaussians model for the posterior at each time step, allowing for an analytic solution to the computationally expensive filter integration step. During non-spike intervals, the filter needs only to update the mean, covariance, and mixture weight of each component. At spike times, a sampling procedure is used to update the filtering distribution and find the number of Gaussian mixture components necessary to maintain an accurate approximation. We illustrate the application of this algorithm to the problem of decoding a rat's position and velocity in a maze from hippocampal place cell data using both 2D and 4D decoders.},

  abstract = {Modern recording techniques enable large-scale measurements of neural activity in a variety of model organisms. The dynamics of neural activity shed light on how organisms process sensory information and generate motor behavior. Here, we study these dynamics using optical recordings of neural activity in the nematode C. elegans. To understand these data, we develop state space models that decompose neural time-series into segments with simple, linear dynamics. We incorporate these models into a hierarchical framework that combines partial recordings from many worms to learn shared structure, while still allowing for individual variability. This framework reveals latent states of population neural activity, along with the discrete behavioral states that govern dynamics in this state space. We find stochastic transition patterns between discrete states and see that transition probabilities are determined by both current brain activity and sensory cues. Our methods automatically recover transition times that closely match manual labels of different behaviors, such as forward crawling, reversals, and turns. Finally, the resulting model can simulate neural data, faithfully capturing salient patterns of whole brain dynamics seen in real data.},

  abstract = {A body of recent work in modeling neural activity focuses on recovering lowdimensional latent features that capture the statistical structure of large-scale neural populations. Most such approaches have focused on linear generative models, where inference is computationally tractable. Here, we propose fLDS, a general class of nonlinear generative models that permits the firing rate of each neuron to vary as an arbitrary smooth function of a latent, linear dynamical state. This extra flexibility allows the model to capture a richer set of neural variability than a purely linear model, but retains an easily visualizable low-dimensional latent space. To fit this class of non-conjugate models we propose a variational inference scheme, along with a novel approximate posterior capable of capturing rich temporal correlations across time. We show that our techniques permit inference in a wide class of generative models.We also show in application to two neural datasets that, compared to state-of-the-art neural population models, fLDS captures a much larger proportion of neural variability with a small number of latent dimensions, providing superior predictive performance and interpretability.},

In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or ``particle'') representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example.},

However, there is growing interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random measures (NRMs).

Developing models for mining such streams is challenged by the huge amount of data that cannot be stored in the memory, the high arrival speed, and the dynamic changes in the data distribution. Density estimation is an important technique in stream mining for a wide variety of applications. The construction of kernel density estimators is well studied and documented. However, existing techniques are either expensive or inaccurate and unable to capture the changes in the data distribution. In this paper, we present a method called KDE-Track to estimate the density of spatiotemporal data streams. KDE-Track can efficiently estimate the density function with linear time complexity using interpolation on a kernel model, which is incrementally updated upon the arrival of new samples from the stream. We also propose an accurate and efficient method for selecting the bandwidth value for the kernel density estimator, which increases its accuracy significantly. Both theoretical analysis and experimental validation show that KDE-Track outperforms a set of baseline methods on the estimation accuracy and computing time of complex density structures in data streams.},

In the proposed framework, processing nodes receive a sequence of data minibatches, compute a variational posterior for each, and make asynchronous streaming updates to a central model. In contrast to previous algorithms, the proposed framework is truly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and truncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from the fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their components, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP posterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper develops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences, and provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an application of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance.},

The duration of ripples shows a skewed distribution with a minority of long-duration events. We discovered that long-duration ripples are increased in situations demanding memory in rats. Prolongation of spontaneously occurring ripples by optogenetic stimulation, but not randomly induced ripples, increased memory during maze learning. The neuronal content of randomly induced ripples was similar to short-duration spontaneous ripples and contained little spatial information. The spike content of the optogenetically prolonged ripples was biased by the ongoing, naturally initiated neuronal sequences. Prolonged ripples recruited new neurons that represented either arm of the maze. Long-duration hippocampal SPW-Rs replaying large parts of planned routes are critical for memory.},

The hallmark of sequential spatial trajectory learning, a model of episodic memory, has remained equivocal, with proposals ranging from de novo creation of compressed sequential replay from blank slate networks to selection of pre-existing compressed preplay sequences. Here, we show that increased millisecond-timescale activation of cell assemblies expressed during de novo sequential experience and increased neuronal firing rate correlations can explain the difference between postexperience trajectory replay and robust preplay. This increased activation results from an improved neuronal tuning to specific cell assemblies, higher recruitment of experience-tuned neurons into preexisting cell assemblies, and increased recruitment of cell assemblies in replay. In contrast, changes in overall neuronal and cell assembly temporal order within extended sequences do not account for sequential trajectory learning. We propose the coordinated strengthening of cell assemblies played sequentially on robust pre-existing temporal frameworks could support rapid formation of episodiclike memory.},

  volume = {29},

  abstract = {Spontaneous neuronal ensemble activity in the hippocampus is believed to result from a combination of preconfigured internally generated dynamics and the unique patterns of activity driven by recent experience. Previous research has established that preconfigured sequential neuronal patterns (i.e., preplay) contribute to the expression of future place cell sequences, which in turn contribute to the sequential neuronal patterns expressed post-experience (i.e., replay). The relative contribution of preconfigured and of experience-related factors to replay and to overall sequential activity during post-run sleep is believed to be highly biased toward the recent run experience, despite never being tested directly. Here, we use multi-neuronal sequence analysis unbiased by firing rate to compute and directly compare the contributions of internally generated and of recent experience-driven factors to the sequential neuronal activity in post-run sleep in na{\"i}ve adult rats. We find that multi-neuronal sequences during post-run sleep are dominantly contributed by the pre-run preconfigured patterns and to a much smaller extent by the place cell sequences and associated awake rest multi-neuronal sequences experienced during de novo run session, which are weakly and similarly correlated with pre- and post-run sleep multi-neuronal sequences. These findings indicate a robust default internal organization of the hippocampal network into sequential neuronal ensembles that withstands a de novo spatial experience and suggest that integration of novel information during de novo experience leading to lasting changes in sequential network patterns is much more subtle than previously assumed.},

This was contrasted with control tasks requiring only working memory or the update of reference memory. Reference memory update led to the reward-directed place field shifts at newly rewarded arms and to the gradual strengthening of firing in passes between newly rewarded arms but not between those passes that included a familiar-rewarded arm. At the maze center, transient network synchronization periods preferentially replayed trajectories of the next chosen arm in reference memory tasks but the previously visited arm in the working memory task. Hence, reference memory demand was uniquely associated with a gradual, goal novelty-related reorganization of place cell assemblies and with trajectory replay that reflected the animal's decision of which arm to visit next.},

We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory. Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal readout of memory-guided paths for learning and decision making.},

  isbn = {978-1-5386-7921-0},
  abstract = {The dynamics of brain activity are inherently nonstationary and can change depending on context, for example based on the tasks performed, the stimuli received, or the attention focus maintained. Thus to decode brain states in naturalistic scenarios, it is necessary to track such changes. Further, it is becoming increasingly common to measure the brain at multiple spatiotemporal scales by recording both spike and field activities simultaneously. Thus tracking non-stationarity necessitates efficient decoders that can detect changes in spikefield neural dynamics and accurately estimate the underlying neural and behavioral states. Here, we develop a new decoding framework to address this challenge. We build a multiscale switching dynamical model that assumes the underlying hidden neural state can evolve with dynamics chosen from an arbitrary finite set. The choice of dynamics could for example be dictated by a higher-level cognitive state such as attention level, which we call a switch state. This switch state would also dictate how the neural state is represented in the recorded binary spike events and continuous field signals, which may also have different time-scales. We use a mix of point process and linear Gaussian process models to characterize the spike-field observations. We derive a new multiscale decoder that simultaneously estimates the underlying neural and switch states from these spike-field observations. We show with closed-loop simulations that our new decoder is able to accurately estimate the switch state while accurately decoding the neural and behavioral states. We also show that not accounting for potential switches in dynamics leads to poor decoding. This new decoder has the potential to enhance future neurotechnologies.},
